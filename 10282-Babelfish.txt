/* 706-LC-Display
 * A friend of yours has just bought a new computer. Before this, the most powerful machine
 * he ever used was a pocket calculator. He is a little disappointed because he liked the LCD
 * display of his calculator more than the screen on his new computer! To make him happy,
 * write a program that prints numbers in LCD display style.
 *
 * Input
 *
 * The input file contains several lines, one for each number to be displayed. Each line
 * contains integers s and n, where n is the number to be displayed ( 0 <= n <= 99, 999, 999) and
 * s is the size in which it shall be displayed (1 <= s <= 10). The input will be terminated by a
 * line containing two zeros, which should not be processed.
 *
 * Output
 *
 * Print the numbers specified in the input file in an LCD display-style using s '-' signs
 * for the horizontal segments and s '|' signs for the vertical ones. Each digit occupies
 * exactly s + 2 columns and 2s + 3 rows. Be sure to fill all the white space occupied
 * by the digits with blanks, including the last digit. There must be exactly one column
 * of blanks between two digits.
 *
 * Output a blank line after each number. You will find an example of each digit in the
 * sample output below.
 *
 * Sample Input
 *
 * 2 12345
 * 3 67890
 * 0 0

 * Sample Output
